# YASH build notes

## ERRATA

In the first run of the PCB, the pins for the clock frequency Molex header are mislabeled. The label should say "Clock W/CW", not "Clock W/CCW".

Also in the first run, the LED footprint silkscreen is on the wrong side of the PCB. The LED should of course be mounted on the same side as the jacks, opposite the other components.

These were corrected after the first run.
